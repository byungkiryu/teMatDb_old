# teMatDb
database of thermoelectric material properties by BR at KERI
_thermoelectric material properties from published papers.
_thermoelectric material properties on temperatures: f(T) with finite number of temperature points.
_thermoelectric material properties: Seebeck coefficient (alpha), electrical resistivity (rho) or electrical conductivity (sigma =1/rho), thermal conductivity (kappa), and figure of merit (ZT).

# files
this db contains (1) single metadata file summarizing database with doi reference, (2) single convenient csv file for materials, (3) 9 excel files with digitized rawdata.

# teMatDb materials id and single merged csv file
the id is running from 1 to 424. Effectively there is 355 complete tep sets. Incomplete TEP sets were excluded in the single merged file.
In the single merged csv file, there is 19,784 tep temperature points.
